1. Event Time : Time at which events are generated at source.
2. Ingestion Time : Time at which event enters at flink via a source. This is a time stamp flink gives to an event.
3. Processing Time : The system time of the machine which is running flink and actually processing these events.

Chronologically :
    Event time
    Ingestion time
    Processing time

Events are generated at source, received at flink and processed them.
Processing time is non deterministic as it depends on whole lot of factors like :- when the data arrives, how long the
operation takes etc.
